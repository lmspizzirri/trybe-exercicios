            <p>Mantis shrimp, or stomatopods, are carnivorous marine crustaceans of the order <b>Stomatopoda</b>,
                branching from other members of the class Malacostraca around 340 million years ago. Mantis shrimp
                typically grow to around 10 cm (3.9 in) in length, while a few can reach up to 38 cm (15 in). A mantis
                shrimp's carapace (the hard, thick shell that covers crustaceans and some other species) covers only the
                rear part of the head and the first four segments of the thorax. Varieties range in colour from shades
                of brown to vivid colours, with more than 450 species of mantis shrimp known. They are among the most
                important predators in many shallow, tropical and subtropical marine habitats. However, despite being
                common, they are poorly understood, as many species spend most of their lives tucked away in burrows and
                holes.</p>

            <h4> The fastest Punch </h4>
            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ed/45/23/ed45235b9a47d70150465c430011eb7e.gif" alt="">
            <p>Mantis shrimps are aggressive relatives of crabs and lobsters and prey upon other animals by crippling
                them with devastating jabs. Their secret weapons are a pair of hinged arms folded away under their head,
                which they can unfurl at incredible speeds.</p>
            <p>When Sheila Patek, a researcher at UC Berkeley, tried to study these heavy-hitters on video, she hit a
                snag. “None of our high speed video systems were fast enough to capture the movement accurately” she
                explained. “Luckily, a BBC crew offered to rent us a super high speed camera as part of their series
                ‘Animal Camera’.”</p>
            <p>With this cutting-edge equipment, Patek managed to capture footage of a smasher’s strike, slowed down <b>
                    800 times </b>. What she found was staggering. With each punch, the club’s edge travels at about <b>
                    50 mph </b>, over twice as fast as scientists had previously estimated.</p>

                <h4>Amazing Eyes</h4>
                <img src="https://i.natgeofe.com/n/7f084ce5-e41f-44a3-a1f2-e9433f7651ae/Mantis-Shrimp-eye.jpg?w=636&h=570"
                    alt="" width="350px">
                <p>Each of the mantis shrimp’s photoreceptors contains seven cells called rhabdoms arranged in a
                    cylinder, and
                    each of these contains thousands of tiny projections called microvilli. In receptors that are
                    sensitive to
                    polarised light, the microvilli are all arranged in one direction, creating a narrow gap that only
                    light
                    vibrating in a certain plane can pass through. Three of the seven rhabdoms are sensitive to one
                    plane of
                    polarised light and the other four are sensitive to a plane that’s perpendicular to it.

                    Sitting atop these seven cells is an eighth rhabdom. In the fifth and sixth rows of the midband, the
                    microvilli in this eighth cell are precisely aligned and everywhere else (and indeed in all other
                    crustaceans), they are randomly arranged. It’s this key innovation that allows the mantis shrimp to
                    see
                    circular polarised light.
